# KMD Logic Consumption Client

A dotnet client library for the KMD Logic billing, which allows applications to record consumption metrics reliably and securely.

The KMD Logic Consumption client utilises many modern concepts from [Serilog](https://serilog.net/) and [Seq](https://getseq.net/), such as [Message Templates](https://messagetemplates.org/) and ingestion endpoints capable of understanding [CLEF](https://docs.getseq.net/docs/posting-raw-events).

## How to use this client library

In projects or components where you need to *generate* consumption metrics, add a NuGet package reference to [Kmd.Logic.Consumption.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Kmd.Logic.Consumption.Client).
 
Use the `IConsumptionMetrics` interface like this:

```c#
consumptionClient
    .ForSubscriptionOwnerContext("ReportableField", "Anything")
    .ForInternalContext("EventNumber", $"{eventNumber}")
    .Record(
        subscriptionId: subscriptionId,
        resourceId: resourceId,
        meter: "SMS/BYO/Send SMS",
        amount: 1,
		consumedDatetime : DatetimeOffset.Now,
        reason: "Just testing");
```

Use the `IReservedCapacityMetrics` interface like this:

```c#
var contextReservedCapacity = reservedCapaty
    .ForSubscriptionOwnerContext("ReportableField", "Anything")
    .ForInternalContext("EventNumber", $"{eventNumber}");

// Increase - Reserve capacity
contextReservedCapacity
    .Increase(
        subscriptionId: subscriptionId,
        resourceId: resourceId,
        meter: "Audit/Instance/Capacity",
        amount: 1,
        dateTime: DateTimeOffset.Now);

// Decrease - release capacity
contextReservedCapacity
    .Decrease(
        subscriptionId: subscriptionId,
        resourceId: resourceId,
        meter: "Audit/Instance/Capacity",
        amount: 1,
        dateTime: DateTimeOffset.Now);
```

### How to setup and configure a container for `AuditClientConsumptionMetricsDestination` or `AuditClientReservedCapacityMetricsDestination`.
To register `AuditClientConsumptionMetricsDestination` or `AuditClientReservedCapacityMetricsDestination` you have to register also the `IAudit` interface from [KMD Logic Audit Client](https://github.com/kmdlogic/kmd-logic-audit-client). 

If you are developing locally, we recommend using `Kmd.Logic.Audit.Client.SerilogSeq.SerilogSeqAuditClient` and install [Seq](https://datalust.co/seq) as the backend. To use Logic as the backend, you must choose `Kmd.Logic.Audit.Client.SerilogAzureEventHubs.SerilogAzureEventHubsAuditClient` as the implementation of IAudit.

Since the client implementations are thread-safe and require disposal, it would be appropriate to use a **singleton** lifetime in a DI container and allow the DI container to dispose of it upon application shut down.

Use `SerilogAzureEventHubsAuditClient` as an implementation of the `IAudit` interface like this:
```c#
var auditClientConfig = new SerilogSeqAuditClientConfiguration
{
    ServerUrl = config.Ingestion.Endpoint,
    ApiKey = config.Ingestion.ApiKey,
    EnrichFromLogContext = config.Client.EnrichFromLogContext,
};

services.AddSingleton(auditClientConfig);
services.AddSingleton<IAudit, SerilogSeqAuditClient>();
```
Use `AuditClientConsumptionMetricsDestination` as an implementation of the `IConsumptionMetricsDestination` interface like this:
```c#
services.AddSingleton<IConsumptionMetricsDestination, AuditClientConsumptionMetricsDestination>();
```
Use `AuditClientReservedCapacityMetricsDestination` as an implementation of the `IReservedCapacityMetricsDestination` interface like this:
```c#
services.AddSingleton<IConsumptionMetricsDestination, AuditClientReservedCapacityMetricsDestination>();
```

> NOTE: We have implemented this functionality initially by reusing [Serilog](https://github.com/serilog/serilog), the [Seq sink](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-sinks-seq) and the [KMD Logic Audit Client](https://github.com/kmdlogic/kmd-logic-audit-client). We intend to publish a version of this client library in the future that has no such external dependencies. If this issue impacts you negatively, please let us know so that we can prioritise appropriately.
