# KMD Logic Consumption Client

This is a dotnet client library for KMD Logic billing, which allows applications to record consumption metrics reliably and securely.

The KMD Logic Consumption client utilises many modern concepts from [Serilog](https://serilog.net/) and [Seq](https://getseq.net/), such as [Message Templates](https://messagetemplates.org/) and ingestion endpoints capable of understanding [CLEF](https://docs.getseq.net/docs/posting-raw-events).

## How to use this client library

In projects or components where you need to *generate* consumption metrics, add a NuGet package reference to [Kmd.Logic.Consumption.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Kmd.Logic.Consumption.Client), and use the `IConsumptionMetrics` interface like this:

```csharp
consumptionClient
    .ForSubscriptionOwnerContext("ReportableField", "Anything")
    .ForInternalContext("EventNumber", "${eventNumber}")
    .Record(
        subscriptionId: subscriptionId,
        resourceId: resourceId,
        meter: "SMS/BYO/Send SMS",
        amount: 1,
        reason: "Just testing");
```

 * Add **Kmd.Logic.Consumption.Client.AuditClient** library from nuget package [Consumption Audit Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Kmd.Logic.Consumption.Client.AuditClient/) to consume Audit client destination which is implemented `IConsumptionMetricsDestination`.

The container(destination) will vary based on customer's implementation . Here we are referring the container(destination)  **kmd.logic.audit.client.serilogazureeventhubs**. This library can be downloaded from [Serilog Azure Eventhubs](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Kmd.Logic.Audit.Client.SerilogAzureEventHubs/). Consumer can change the exiting destination by using defined destination. The defined destination has to be injected into concrete class of `IConsumptionMetrics`. Example as in below:
```csharp
var auditClient = new SerilogAzureEventHubsAuditClient(clientConfig);            
var auditConsumptionDestination = new AuditClientConsumptionMetricsDestination(auditClient);
var consumptionClient = new ConsumptionClient(auditConsumptionDestination);         
```


> NOTE: We have implemented this functionality initially by reusing [Serilog](https://github.com/serilog/serilog), the [Seq sink](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-sinks-seq) and the [KMDLogic audit](https://github.com/kmdlogic/kmd-logic-audit-client). We intend to publish a version of this client library in the future that has no such external dependencies. If this issue impacts you negatively, please let us know.
